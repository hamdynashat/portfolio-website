# ðŸ“§ Email Setup Guide for Contact Form

This guide will help you set up EmailJS to make your contact form fully functional and receive messages directly to your email.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Add Email Service
1. In your EmailJS dashboard, click "Email Services"
2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose **Gmail** (recommended) or your preferred email provider
4. Follow the setup instructions:
   - For Gmail: You'll need to allow "Less secure app access" or use App Passwords
   - Enter your email credentials
5. **Copy the Service ID** (you'll need this later)

### Step 3: Create Email Template
1. Go to "Email Templates" in your dashboard
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template content:

**Subject:** New Contact Form Message: {{subject}}

**Body:**
```
Hello Hamdy,

You have received a new message from your portfolio website!

From: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
This message was sent from your portfolio contact form.
```

4. **Copy the Template ID** (you'll need this later)

### Step 4: Get Your Public Key
1. Go to "Account" settings in EmailJS dashboard
2. Find your **Public Key** (User ID)
3. **Copy the Public Key**

### Step 5: Update Your Website Code
1. Open `script.js` in your portfolio folder
2. Find this line: `emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");`
3. Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with your actual public key from Step 4

4. Find this line: `emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', templateParams)`
5. Replace:
   - `YOUR_SERVICE_ID` with your Service ID from Step 2
   - `YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID` with your Template ID from Step 3

**Example:**
```javascript
// Replace this:
emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', templateParams)

// With this (using your actual IDs):
emailjs.init("user_1234567890abcdef");
emailjs.send('service_gmail', 'template_contact', templateParams)
```
